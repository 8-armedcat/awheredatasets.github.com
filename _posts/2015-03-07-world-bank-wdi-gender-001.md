## Description
---
The primary World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially-recognized international sources. It presents the most current and accurate global development data available, and includes national, regional and global estimates.  

Women's empowerment and the promotion of gender equality are key to achieving sustainable development. Greater gender equality can enhance economic efficiency and improve other development outcomes by removing barriers that prevent women from having the same access as men to human resource endowments, rights, and economic opportunities. Giving women access to equal opportunities allows them to emerge as social and economic actors, influencing and shaping more inclusive policies. Improving women’s status also leads to more investment in their children’s education, health, and overall wellbeing. Data here covers demography, education, health, labor force and employment, and political participation.

## Other Information
----
aWhere has taken some data cleaning steps to make this data available in the platform. 

### Data Cleaning
The original World Development Gender Indicators dataset contains 136 variables. All of these variables are available through the [WDI](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WDI/index.html) package in R.

The original dataset includes regions and areas that cannot be mapping on aWhere platform [Dev aWhere](http://apps.awhere.com/). Those regions and areas were removed, but all individual country data was retained. These regions are: Africa, Arab World, Caribbean small states, Central Europe and the Baltics, Channel Islands, East Asia & Pacific (all income levels), East Asia & Pacific (developing only), Euro area, Europe & Central Asia (all income levels), Europe & Central Asia (developing only), European Union, Fragile and conflict affected situations, Heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC), High income, High income: nonOECD, High income: OECD, Latin America & Caribbean (all income levels), Latin America & Caribbean (developing only), Least developed countries: UN classification, Low & middle income, Low income, Lower middle income, Middle East & North Africa (all income levels), Middle East & North Africa (developing only), Middle income, North Africa, North America, Not classified, OECD members, Other small states, Pacific island small states, Sint Maarten (Dutch part), Small states, South Asia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Sub-Saharan Africa (all income levels), Sub-Saharan Africa (developing only), Sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa and Nigeria, Upper middle income, West Bank and Gaza, World.

The data cleaning also removed empty records (countries that do not have any data for any variable).

##Description

FAOSTAT provides time-series and cross sectional  data relating to food and agriculture for some 200 countries. It is available in English, French and Spanish. This database includes indicators in areas like Food Security, Production, Trade, Food Balance, Prices, Inputs, Population, Investment, Agri-Environmental Indicators, Agriculture Emission, Land Use Emission, Forestry, ASTI R&D Indicators, and Emergency Responses.   

The FAOSTAT Emissions Agriculture database provides country-level estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on FAOSTAT activity data and using Tier 1 computations, following 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. Technical details of specific activity data used and relevant computational steps employed are given in the Methodology and Quality Information section of the metadata for each of the sectors in the domain. 

The FAOSTAT Emissions database can provide significant support to FAO member countries, along four key dimensions:

- Regular updates of global and regional trends in GHG emissions from agriculture, forestry and land use;
- Capacity development of member countries towards improved analysis of GHG emissions and identification of data gaps;
- Quality Control and Quality Assurance procedures for GHG Inventories;
- Development of indicators linking GHG emissions to their underlying commodities. [[FAO][6]]

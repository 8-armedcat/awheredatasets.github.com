## Description
---
The Global Open Data Index collects and presents information on the current state of open data release around the world. The Global Open Data Index is run by Open Knowledge and reviewed by volunteers from the Open Knowledge network and around the world. The first Open Data Index was released on October 28, 2013.

In 2013 the Index included 60 countries. In 2014 we have extended our scope to include 37 additional countries, mainly from Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Therefore we have put additional effort into trying to locate contributors and experts from these regions. This way we believe the Index will more accurately portray the state of the open government data landscape worldwide.

The Global Open Data Index is not a representation of the official government open data offering in each country, but an independent assessment from a citizen perspective.

The Global Open Data Index is not only a benchmarking tool, it also plays a powerful role in building the open government data community around the world. If, for example, the government of a country does publish a dataset, but this is not clear to the public and cannot be found through a simple search, then the data can easily be overlooked. Governments and open data practitioners can review the Index results to see how accessible the open data they publish actually appears to citizens, and where improvements are necessary to make open data really open and useful.

## Methodology
----
The Index uses a non-probability sampling technique - a “snowball sample”. A snowball sample tries to locate subject of studies in areas which are hard to locate. In our case, we work with contributors who are interested in open government data activity who can assess the availability and quality of open datasets in their respective locations. We do so not only by using referrals, but also by posting in social media, through our Open Government Data and Open Data Census mailing lists and even actively by meeting people face-to-face in conferences. This means that anyone from any place can participate and contribute to the Global Open Data Index as a contributor and make submissions, which are then reviewed. We do not have a quota on the number of places that can participate. Rather, we are aiming to sample as many places as we can.

Please notice that some places were submitted only in 2013 and did not have data for 2014 and therefore most of these places have been removed from the 2013 Index data as it’s displayed on the current site. As a result, the site shows 60 places in the Index 2013, not the full list of 70 places as published originally. This was done since we didn’t get any resubmissions in 2014. Two countries were left on the Index and their data was pushed from 2013 - Poland and Singapore who were expected to submit data but never did. The list of the countries that were removed: Saint Kitts and Nevis, Virgin Islands, British, Yemen, Bahrain, Bahamas, Barbados, Vatican City, Gibraltar, Cayman island, Guernsey, Jersey. These places have not been included in the ranking for Index 2013 as it appears on the site, which means the ranking for places on the Index 2013 can be different from the original Index 2013 ranking.

This also has an impact on the quality of the data we collected in the first stage of the Global Open Data Index. Contributors have diverse knowledge and backgrounds in open data and therefore they sometimes need help finding the data we are looking for. The following section will explain how we try to deal with this problem.

## Other Information
----
aWhere has taken some data cleaning steps to make this data available in the platform. 

### Data Cleaning
The original dataset consists 4 downloadable data files: Entries, Datasets, Places, Questions. The data cleaning process has combined the Entries and Places to turn this dataset geographically and temporally referenced. The Questions was used to create metadata for this dataset. 

The metadata of the following indicators was mapped using the Questions data file: 

- exists: Does the data exist
- digital: Is data in digital form
- public: Publicly available
- online: Is the data available online
- free: Is the data available for free
- machinereadable: Is the data machine readable
- bulk: Available in bulk
- openlicense: Openly licensed
- uptodate: Is the data provided on a timely and up to date basis
- url: URL of data online
- format: Format of data
- licenseurl: URL to license or terms of use
- dateavailable: Date data first openly available
- publisher: Data Publisher
- details: Further Details and Comments (optional but strongly encouraged)

The metadata of the following indicators was not provided. Based on the data file structure, following names are assigned: 

- title (in Datasets file): Name of dataset
- category (in Datasets file): Category of dataset
- description (in Datasets file): Description of dataset
- isopen: Is this dataset open
- officialtitle: Official Title
- score (in Datasets file): Dataset Score in 2014
- rank (in Datasets file): Dataset Rank in 2014
- score_2013 (in Datasets file): Dataset Score in 2013
- rank_2013 (in Datasets file): Dataset Rank in 2013
- score (in Places file): Country Score in 2014
- rank (in Places file): Country Rank in 2014
- score_2013 (in Places file): Country Score in 2013
- rank_2013 (in Places file): Country Rank in 2013
- score: Score
- rank: Rank
- timestamp: Timestamp  (open data index)
- submitters: Entry information submitters  (open data index)
- reviewers: Entry information reviewers  (open data index)
- submitters (in Places file): Country information submitters (open data index)
- reviewers (in Places file): Country information reviewers (open data index)

The dataset.1 indicator from the Entries file contains repeating information. It was removed from the dataset. 

The isopen indicator contains answers as TRUE or FALSE, this was replaced as Yes or No. The answers for exists, digital, public, online, free, machinereadable, bulk, openlicense, and uptodate are all Y or N, they were replaced by Yes or No. 

The data cleaning also altered country names to enable loading to aWhere platform. Changes as limited to spelling of the country names.

## Description
---
AfricaFertilizer.org is a global initiative facilitating the exchange of information on soil fertility, fertilizers, and good agricultural practices in Africa. AfricaFertilizer.org is led by IFDC, in partnership with the International Fertilizer Industry Association (IFA), the African Fertilizer and Agribusiness Partnership (AFAP), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) through its CountrySTAT program, and the African Union Commission (AUC) and its NEPAD Planning and Coordination Agency. 

AFOâ€™s initiative supports all African countries, with a focus on the 39 Sub-Saharan African countries. AFO provides priority support and technical assistance to national statistical counterparts as CountrySTAT Fertilizer Technical Working Groups in seven countries: Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, and Tanzania. Support to these priority countries includes onside technical trainings and validation workshops to ensure the proper documentation and dissemination of robust fertilizer statistics at national and sub-national levels (including on production, trade, consumption, use by crop, directories and products). 

AFO, in collaboration with the East Africa Community and the Economic and Monetary Union of West African States, provides customized support to 10 countries. AFO provides remote and physical support to 12 other Sub-Saharan Africa countries.

## Other Information
----
aWhere has taken some data cleaning steps to make this data available in the  Dev aWhere [platform](2). 

### Data Cleaning
The original dataset included 1 down loadable file in xls format. The data cleaning process involved changing the data structure to a "wide" data structure where each indicator is mapped to a unique location and time combination. The data cleaning also include reconstructing metadata information by scraping information from Africafertilizer.org website

The data cleaning process also:

- Un-merged the excel cells for country and indicators, replaced each empty cell with the most recent non-empty cell prior to it. 
- Converted the date variable into one common format; the raw data provided month and year, the cleaned data provided date in "yyyy-mm" format.  
- Matching and converting country names for aWhere platform compatibility

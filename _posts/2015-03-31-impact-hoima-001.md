## Description
---
The CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) is a 10-year research initiative that seeks to overcome the threats to agriculture and food security in a changing climate, exploring new ways of helping vulnerable rural communities adjust to global changes in climate.

The objective of this survey is to capture within-site variability on key livelihood indicators that could be used for a range of analysis including the modelling of impact of adaptation and mitigation strategies on livelihoods, food security and the environment. Furthermore, the collection of standard indicators across sites could derive suitable parameters for regional integrated assessments. 

This dataset contains 200 households from the Hoima Site. For more information please view: [website](1)

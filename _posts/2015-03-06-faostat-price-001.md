##Description

FAOSTAT provides time-series and cross sectional  data relating to food and agriculture for some 200 countries. It is available in English, French and Spanish. This database includes indicators in areas like Food Security, Production, Trade, Food Balance, Prices, Inputs, Population, Investment, Agri-Environmental Indicators, Agriculture Emission, Land Use Emission, Forestry, ASTI R&D Indicators, and Emergency Responses.   

The Prices domain of FAOSTAT contains:  

- Annual Producer Prices or prices received by farmers for primary crops, live animals and livestock primary products as collected at the farm-gate or at the first point of sale. Data are provided through annual questionnaires for over 130 countries and for some 200 commodities, representing over 97 percent of the world’s value of gross agricultural production (at 2004-2006 International Dollar Prices).
- Monthly producer prices, collected from 2010 onwards. The availability of infra-annual data on prices allows a better understanding of price responses to short term shocks, which are a major feature of agricultural markets. They also enable a more timely and accurate monitoring of prices received by farmers and how these are transmitted along the value chain. These prices are provided in Local Currency Units (LCU) only. They are based on the same definitions and concepts than Annual Producer Prices and are provided according to the same classification of commodities. Monthly prices are collected in conjunction with annual prices and updated yearly.
- Annual Producer Price Indices that measure the average annual change in the prices received by farmers. Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. Producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise the Agriculture Producer Price Index, Commodity group indices and Single item indices.
- Consumer price indices, annual and monthly (or quarterly) of all items, covering all goods and services, and for the food and non-alcoholic beverages group. These indices measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire for consumption. These indices are originally compiled and disseminated by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).[[FAO][6]]

##Other Information

The original Price dataset included 3681 attributes. 468 of these attributes were not provided through the FAOSTAT [R package][7]. These attributes are detailed price data of specific crops. The categories of these attributes are: 

- Producer Prices Archive
- Producer Price Indices Annual
- Producer Prices Monthly
- Producer Prices Annual


The original dataset also included regions and areas that cannot be mapped on the [Dev aWhere platform][8], which were removed. These regions are: 
  
- Belgium-Luxembourg
- Aruba
- Solomon Islands
- Cook Islands
- Czechoslovakia

The original dataset did not provide any **unit** information for attributes in Producer Price - Monthly category. According a previous FAOSTAT version [FAOSTAT][9], and definition of Producer Price [OECD][10] these units were assigned as LCU/tonne.  

> These prices are provided in Local Currency Units (LCU) only.

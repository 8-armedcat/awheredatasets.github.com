### Data Cleaning

The original dataset includes farm gate price for 18 crops in 2 years through a pdf report. Data cleaning includes: extracted the information from the report; changed the data format to meeting aWhere platform loading requirement; replaced unknown symbols ("-" or ".") with empty data points; grouped crops according to aWhere crop classification rules; assign units. 

The 18 farm gate price data was coded as "Farm gate price - crop" and categorized into the following categories:

- Beverage and spice crops
- Cereals
- Fruit and nuts
- Leguminous crops
- Oilseed crops
- Other crops
- Root crops
- Sugar crops
- Vegetables and melons

The original dataset has used naira/kg or naira/litre as units and didn't specify how the unit was associated with crops. The dataset has adopted naire per kg as harmonized unit.

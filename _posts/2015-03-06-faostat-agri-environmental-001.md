##Description

FAOSTAT provides time-series and cross sectional data relating to food and agriculture for some 200 countries. It is available in English, French and Spanish. This database includes indicators in areas like Food Security, Production, Trade, Food Balance, Prices, Inputs, Population, Investment, Agri-Environmental Indicators, Agriculture Emission, Land Use Emission, Forestry, ASTI R&D Indicators, and Emergency Responses.  

FAOSTAT has implemented structured and comprehensive metadata that can be useful not only for statisticians who compile, validate and analyse the data, but also for users who  access and use the data. The development and construction of a metadata repository and its full integration with statistical data are therefore upcoming key components of the FAOSTAT system. The metadata system enhances understanding of any given data item within FAOSTAT – by managing the documentation of related concepts and definitions, its source, the history of its values and the methodology used in its collection. The FAOSTAT system  makes available the following statistical metadata: concepts and definitions, classifications, reference data (symbols, units and conversion factors), statistical methodology, data releases and data quality indicators.   

Agri-Environmental data is organized in domains. Domain group includes Air and Climate Change, Energy, Fertilizers, Land, Livestock, Pesticides, Soil, and Water [[FAO][6]]

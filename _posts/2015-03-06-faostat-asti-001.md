## Description
---
FAOSTAT provides time-series and cross sectional  data relating to food and agriculture for some 200 countries. It is available in English, French and Spanish. This database includes indicators in areas like Food Security, Production, Trade, Food Balance, Prices, Inputs, Population, Investment, Agri-Environmental Indicators, Agriculture Emission, Land Use Emission, Forestry, ASTI R&D Indicators, and Emergency Responses.   

This ASTI R&D Indicators includes information about R&D expenditure and number of researchers. Led by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators (ASTI) is a trusted comprehensive source of information on agricultural R&D statistics. ASTI has published a broad set of country and regional reports and analytical publications that examine agricultural R&D trends at national, regional; and global levels, while at the same time providing comparative data on agricultural R&D performance across countries and regions [ASTI][6].
